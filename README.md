# Finite Difference Methods for Option Pricing

This repository contains implementations of finite difference methods for pricing American and European options. Developed as a course project for M2MO, it explores various numerical schemes—including Explicit/Implicit Euler, Crank–Nicolson, and PSOR—with diagnostic tools and sparse matrix optimizations.

## Features

- **American & European Options:** Pricing using finite difference methods.
- **Numerical Schemes:** Explicit/Implicit Euler, Crank–Nicolson, PSOR, and higher-order methods.
- **Diagnostics:** Tools to assess stability, convergence, and efficiency.
- **Optimizations:** Sparse matrix implementations for improved performance.
- **Analytical Comparison:** Comparison with the Black–Scholes formula.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- numpy
- matplotlib
- pandas
